# ðŸ§­ Maze Solver with Tkinter and Streamlit

A visual and interactive application that generates random mazes and solves them using classic pathfinding algorithms such as **BFS**, **DFS**, **A\***, **Greedy Best-First Search**, and **Uniform Cost Search**.  
Supports both **desktop GUI (Tkinter)** and **web interface (Streamlit)**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

- Generate random mazes using recursive DFS algorithm.
- Visualize how different search algorithms find the path from start to goal.
- Evaluate and compare algorithm performance in terms of steps and path length.
- Provide both a desktop and a browser-based interface.
